"""drop_client_and_rate_applied_from_work_logs

Revision ID: a1b2c3d4e5f6
Revises: 32a6a8b2c9ff
Create Date: 2026-05-08 11:30:00.000000

Rationale:
- `client` is not a fixed field — it belongs to company-defined extraData (worklog_definitions).
- `rate_applied` is redundant: the same value is already stored inside `calculation_snapshot->rate_applied`,
  which also provides the full historic context (definition, taxes, display lines, etc.).
